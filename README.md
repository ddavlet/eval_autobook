# Automatically booking evaluation slots program

At 42, students are required to schedule evaluation slots for their projects. 
Occasionally, due to high demand, available slots may become scarce, 
prompting students to patiently await their availability 
or continuously refresh the page.

I have developed an automated code solution 
to streamline the process by reserving evaluation slots 
as soon as they become accessible.
